### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a second year student studying information processing science at University of Oulu.
During my studies I have learned a lot about software development basics, and I am especially interested in both web and game development.
Currently my programming skill set consists of:
  - Java
  - C
  - SQL
  - Python

Java is my main language at the moment, and most of my projects are written in it. In the future I would like to familiarize myself with Javascript and C++.
If you would like to see some examples of my awesome code from my private repositories, feel free to contact me!

Kind regards,
Joonas Multaniemi
